        A dungeon is a dark, underground prison or cell, usually in a castle. Dungeons are often associated
            with medieval castles, but their association with torture may come from the Renaissance period.

        <p style="color: rgb(4, 112, 15); font-size: 20;border: 5px solid greenyellow;">The word dungeon, meaning “a dark usually underground prison,”
            comes from the French word donjon, which
            also gives us our English word donjon, meaning “an inner tower in a castle.”Dungeon was first used in
            English
            in the 14th century for the strong tower in the inner part of the castle.

        <p style="color: rgb(4, 112, 15); font-size: 20;border: 5px solid greenyellow;">A "character unique in a game" refers to a playable character
            within a video game that stands out
            significantly
            from other characters due to their distinct appearance, abilities, personality, backstory, or gameplay
            mechanics, essentially making them a unique and memorable part of the game experience. </p>

            A goblin is a small, grotesque, monstrous humanoid creature that appears in the folklore of multiple
            European cultures. First attested in stories from the Middle Ages, they are ascribed conflicting abilities,
            temperaments, and appearances depending on the story and country of origin, ranging from mischievous
            household spirits to malicious, bestial thieves.

        <h3>Wolf monster</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(95, 197, 6); font-size: 15;border: 5px solid greenyellow;">
             <img
                src="/my project/image/wolves_by_michalivan_d2pxlss-fullview.jpg" alt="wolf">
            The wolf monster is a fearsome creature with glowing red eyes and razor-sharp fangs. Standing on its hind
            legs, it towers over its prey, exuding a menacing aura. Its fur is thick and matted, dark as the night,
            providing camouflage in the wilderness. It possesses supernatural strength and agility, making it a
            formidable adversary. Often found howling at the moon, the wolf monster strikes terror into the hearts of
            those who encounter it.

        <h3>Zombie mpnster</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(95, 197, 6); font-size: 15;border: 5px solid greenyellow;">
            <img
                src="/my project/image/0e3130aece144c0599f6bcf7370940a5.jpg" alt="zombie">
            The zombie monster is a grotesque and decaying creature that roams the night in search of its next victim.
            Its skin is rotting and peeling, revealing bones and sinew beneath. With hollow, lifeless eyes and an
            unending hunger for human flesh, it shuffles and moans in a relentless pursuit. Possessing unnatural
            strength, it can tear through barriers with ease. The mere sight of a zombie monster strikes terror into the
            hearts of the living.
        </p>
        <h3>skeleton monster</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(95, 197, 6); font-size: 15;border: 5px solid greenyellow;">
            <img src="/my project/image/Skeletons.webp" alt="skeleton">
            The skeleton monster is a ghastly apparition composed entirely of bones, clattering and creaking as it
            moves. Its empty eye sockets glow with an eerie light, and it wields ancient, rusted weapons. Animated by
            dark magic, it is relentless and unyielding in battle. Cloaked in tattered remnants of its former self, it
            emanates a chilling aura. The sight of a skeleton monster sends shivers down the spine of even the bravest
            souls.
        </p>
        <h3>Slimes monster</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(95, 197, 6); font-size: 15;border: 5px solid greenyellow;"> <img src="/my project/image/slime-monsters-fantastic-jelly-stain-260nw-2363062251.webp" alt="slimes">
            The slime monster is an amorphous, gelatinous creature that oozes and slithers through dark and damp
            environments. Its translucent, gooey body can engulf and digest anything it touches. Despite its seemingly
            slow movement, it can rapidly change shape and size to ensnare its prey. The slime monster emits a foul,
            acidic stench, adding to its repulsive nature. Encountering this creature is a nightmarish experience for
            anyone unfortunate enough to cross its path.
