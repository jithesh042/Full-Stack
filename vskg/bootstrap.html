        It a game about entering the dungeon with minimum 100 floors. A dungeon is a dark, underground prison or cell,
        usually in a castle. Dungeons are often associated
        with medieval castles, but their association with torture may come from the Renaissance period. <br>
        
        The word dungeon, meaning “a dark usually underground prison,” comes from the French word donjon, which
        also gives us our English word donjon, meaning “an inner tower in a castle.”Dungeon was first used in English
        in the 14th century for the strong tower in the inner part of the castle. <br>

        A "character unique in a game" refers to a playable character within a video game that stands out significantly

        mechanics, essentially making them a unique and memorable part of the game experience.
