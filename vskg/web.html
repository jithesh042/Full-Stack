        Paris (French pronunciation: [paʁi] ) is the capital and largest city of France. With
        an estimated population of
        2,102,650 residents in January 2023 in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi), Paris is the fourth-most
        populous city in the European Union, the ninth-most populous city in Europe and the 30th most densely populated
        city in the world in 2022. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of
        finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. Because of its leading role in the arts and
        sciences and its early adaptation of extensive street lighting, it became known as the City of Light in the 19th
        century.

    <p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally
        "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications in China. They were built across the historical
        northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from
        the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin
        dynasty.Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming
        dynasty .</p>

    <p>A pyramid (from Ancient Greek πυραμίς (puramís) 'pyramid') is a structure whose visible surfaces are
        triangular in broad outline and converge toward the top, making the appearance roughly a pyramid in the
        geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be of any polygon shape, such as triangular or quadrilateral, and its
        lines either filled or stepped.

        A pyramid has the majority of its mass closer to the ground with less mass towards the pyramidion at the
        apex. This is due to the gradual decrease in the cross-sectional area along the vertical axis with increasing
        elevation. This offers a weight distribution that allowed early civilizations to create monumental structures.
